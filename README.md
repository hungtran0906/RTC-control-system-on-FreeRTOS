## RTC control system on FreeRTOS
This is my project on STM32F407 Discovery with reference to the Mastering RTOS documentation
## Project Requirement
* Develop a real-time clock control system.
* Create tasks for UART ,RTC, LED and Software Timer.
* Implement software timer for dynamic LED effects and accurate time reporting.
* Optimize task communication uses FreeRTOS queue.
* Use UART interrupts to receive data enough.
